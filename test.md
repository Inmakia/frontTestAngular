Create a small application with Angular (1.x),

+ The application must be localized in 2 languages and configurable (i.e.: default language)

+ According to the JSON data, implement a list of shipments that can be sorted by date and status

+ You should have a build script (using the tool you want) that "minifies" the JS files (vendors, application + template files) and the html.

+ Bonus points if you use Git, you can use a local git repository.
